## Problem Statement

This solution provides a detailed record for each order, including item counts, garment types, care instructions, and payment status, reducing the chance of lost items.

## Quantifiable Impact and Insights

- **90% Accuracy in Order Tracking**: Detailed entries reduce garment misplacement.
- **40% Faster Order Processing**: Automated updates with dynamic tables streamline operations.
- **100% Dynamic Report Refresh**: Real-time inventory, payment, and sales insights using Power Pivot.
- **Increased Customer Satisfaction**: With full transparency, customers experience fewer issues with misplaced items.
