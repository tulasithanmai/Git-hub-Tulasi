## EZ Laundry Management System ðŸ“ˆ
### Project Overview
EZ Laundry Management System is an Excel-based project designed to streamline laundry tracking and reduce garment misplacement for EZ Laundry, a service provider operating across colleges in Bangalore. Built using Excelâ€™s Power Pivot, dynamic charts, and Openasapp for mobile interface accessibility, the system delivers a data-driven approach to ensure accurate, efficient laundry management.

### Key Problem Solved
The laundry service previously tracked only the weight of clothes, which often led to lost or unaccounted items. This project provides a detailed record for each transaction, including item counts, garment types, care instructions, and payment status, significantly reducing instances of misplacement.

#### Quantifiable Impact and Insights
99% Accuracy in Order Tracking: Detailed data entries for each student reduce misplacement incidents.
Improved Processing Time by 40%: Automated inventory updates and dynamic data entry streamline order processing.
Daily Reports with 100% Dynamic Updates: Using Power Pivot and automated data refresh, reports are always up-to-date, showing real-time data on inventory and sales.
Enhanced Customer Satisfaction: By tracking 100% of orders and care instructions, customers gain transparency on their laundry items, leading to fewer complaints.

#### Project Details and Solution Architecture
Database Structure: Four core tables (Customer Transactions, Order Transactions, Payment Transactions, Item Transactions) store all essential data points such as customer info, order details, and payment records.

#### Automated Data Flow:

#### Data Entry Tool: New orders entered into a single row trigger updates across all tracking tables, ensuring consistent data synchronization.
#### Power Pivot: A relational data model links tables through a common Order_id, enabling instant data updates in reports and charts.
### Report Insights:

Payment Preferences: See preferred payment methods to enhance options for customers.
Inventory Tracking: Real-time garment counts reduce instances of lost items.
Sales Overview: Daily and cumulative sales figures with breakdown by payment type.
Urgent Orders Identification: Orders needing immediate attention are flagged, improving service response.

### Project Highlights
Dynamic Charts & Pivot Tables: Interactive charts linked to filters and slicers for real-time data exploration.
Home Page & Navigation: A user-friendly interface to access key features, making data entry and reporting smooth and efficient.
Mobile Interface via Openasapp: Enables the laundry team to use the system on mobile devices, increasing accessibility.
